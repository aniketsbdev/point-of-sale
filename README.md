# point-of-sale
POS system for a basic store.
To start the project, Open the API Folder in a terminal and type in 
` npm start `

After that, open the UI/point-of-sale folder in another terminal and type in 
`ng serve `

For now you can login to the system as the Login API is not implemented by clicking on the Login button.
